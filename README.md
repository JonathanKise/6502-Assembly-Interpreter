Certainly! Hereâ€™s a reformatted version that explains the project can run the 6502 instruction set in Node.js and includes an example of the code that can be written:

# 6502 Assembly in Node.js

This project allows you to run the 6502 instruction set in a Node.js environment. Below is an example of the kind of assembly code you can write and execute using this project.

## Usage

Clone the repository and follow the setup instructions to run 6502 assembly code. Change the `JMP TESTX` instruction to the desired test to see the corresponding behavior.

```assembly
JMP TEST4  ; CHANGE THIS VALUE TO SET WHAT GETS TESTED
RETURN:
    BRK

TEST1:
    ; **** LOAD INC AND DEC TEST ****
    LDA #$2C 
    LDX #$3
    DEX
    INY
    ; Expected Behavior
    ; X--, Y++
    JMP RETURN

TEST2:
    ; **** STACK TESTING ****
    LDA #$2C
    PHA
    LDA #$0
    PLA
    ; Expected Behavior
    ; Push from the Accumulator to Stack
    ; When pulled from Stack to Accumulator 
    ; the value of 2C should be loaded into A
    JMP RETURN

TEST3:
    ; **** READING AND WRITING MEMORY ****
    LDA #$2C
    STA $0400
    LDA #$0
    LDA $0400
    ; Expected Behavior
    ; Will read from and write to memory
    ; Thus the value of 2C should be loaded into A
    JMP RETURN

TEST4:
    ; **** FLAGS AND BRANCH TESTING ****
    SEC
    CLC
    BCC TESTINGBRANCH
    LDA #$2C
TESTINGBRANCH:
    LDA #$3C
    ; Expected Behavior
    ; LDA 2C will be skipped and 3C will be loaded into A
    JMP RETURN
```
